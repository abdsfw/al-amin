## What is the application?
It is a private educational application that publishes various learning tracks, most of which are related to civil engineering subjects at Tishreen University in Latakia, Syria.

## Application description
This application targets university students, offering content that helps them learn various skills, such as using applications like AutoCAD and Revit, among others. Students can purchase the desired course by buying a special code from one of the sales centers. Each course consists of several lessons, which include PDF files and a video for each lesson, All files are protected against screenshotting and screen recording.

### onboarding

Upon the first launch of the application, the system will verify the device's location to ensure it is genuine, preventing devices with a tampered system or rooted access from using the app. Additionally, it will check if the developer options are enabled. If the developer options are enabled or the location services are turned off, the user will be presented with an interface that allows them to navigate to disable developer mode and  to enable location services.

### auth screens

Registration in the system is required by entering the necessary data as shown in the interface, followed by logging in through the login screen. However, upon the first login, it is not possible to log into the app again from the same account after uninstalling the program. This is to prevent a single account from being purchased and shared among multiple users.

### college and course screens

After accessing the faculties interface, you must select a faculty and then the academic year to view the available courses. Currently, courses are available only for the Faculty of Civil Engineering. Upon entering a specific course, you will see that the lessons are locked until a special course code is purchased. However, the course publisher can unlock any lesson for everyone, typically the first lesson, which usually provides an introduction to the course content.
